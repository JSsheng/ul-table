# Set up

Refer to the `.env` file to create a `.env.local` file and fill in the variable value as follows:

```bash
# request base url
VITE_APP_BASE_API=

# default userName
VITE_USER_NAME=

# default password(raw password)
VITE_PWD=
```

**Note that**: the `.env` file will be pushed to the remote repo, while the `.env.local` file will not. So, do not put sensitive information in the `.env` file
